I coded the whole project in python. It was a quick solution for a problem that a friend of mine had. The project took no more than 35 minutes and has been very effective.

### How to set it up

1. To set up all you need to do is go to this website to get an API KEY (you might have to refresh when you load in): 

https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

2. Copy that API Key into the api_key variable 

3. Run: ```pip install -r requirements.txt --user```
